# Core
* Added presets based on the selected language to the installer. This allows for a more tailored installation experience, where the default settings and configurations can be adjusted according to the language chosen by the user during the installation process.
* Changed the location of the language selection to have it always available as a dropdown in the header instead of the previous text-based links in the footer. This change enhances usability by making language selection more prominent and accessible throughout the installation process.
