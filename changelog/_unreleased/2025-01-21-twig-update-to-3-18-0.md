# Core
* Added `Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig\Node\MacroOverrideNode` Class to support App Script in new TWIG Version 3.18.0 and Shopware Version 6.6.10.0
  * For more Information, see also the [deprecation page](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/deprecated.html) of TWIG 3.0.
  * If you are interested in the changed files between these two versions have a look [here](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/compare/v3.14.2...v3.18.0).
* Added `Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig\TokenParser\SwMacroFunctionTokenParser` Class to have our own Macro node (will be the new default in Shopware Version 6.8.0)
* Changed class `\Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Twig\SwTwigFunction` is now internal and should not be used anymore.
