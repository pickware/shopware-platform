# Storefront
* Changed Google Consent Mode v2 implementation to properly use `default` command with only denied states and `update` command for granted states (see: https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?hl=en&consentmode=advanced#default-consent)
* Changed the consent initialization to always set all consent types to `denied` by default
* Added separate `update` call that only grants consents based on cookie preferences in `src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/component/analytics.html.twig`
