## Contributing to the Shopware code base
If you want to learn how to contribute code to Shopware, please refer to [Contributing Code](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/resources/guidelines/code/contribution.html).
Also, make sure that you add a changelog file that describes your changes in a meaningful way. For more information refer to [this document](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2020-08-03-implement-new-changelog.md).

## Local Docker Setup

The repository contains a Docker setup to run the application locally. You can start the containers with `docker compose up -d` and build the project with `docker compose exec web composer setup`.
This will download the necessary dependencies and set up the environment for development. After the setup is complete, you can access the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The Administration can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) and the Username is `admin` with the Password `shopware`.

To run the Administration Watcher you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec web composer watch:admin
```

and the Watcher is available at [http://localhost:5773](http://localhost:5773).

To run the Storefront Watcher you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec web composer watch:storefront
```

and the Watcher is available at [http://localhost:9998](http://localhost:9998).

To access the database you can go to [http://localhost:9080](http://localhost:9080) and use the following credentials:

- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`
- Database: `database`

### Configuring PHPStorm to Run in Docker

In PHPStorm you need to create a new PHP Interpreter from Docker Compose and select the `web` service.
Make sure you set the Lifecycle to **Connect to existing container** to speed up test execution.

### Running tools

You will need to prepend to all commands `docker compose exec web` to run the commands in the container. For example:

```bash
docker compose exec web composer setup
```

For all commands see [Command Overview](#command-overview).


### Enable Profiler/Debugging for PHP

To enable XDebug, you will need to create a `compose.override.yaml`

```yaml
services:
    web:
        environment:
            - XDEBUG_MODE=debug
            - XDEBUG_CONFIG=client_host=host.docker.internal
            - PHP_PROFILER=xdebug
```

and then run `docker compose up -d` to apply the changes.

It also supports `blackfire`, `tideways` and `pcov`. For `tideways` and `blackfire` you will need a separate container like:

```yaml
services:
    web:
        environment:
            - PHP_PROFILER=blackfire
    blackfire:
        image: blackfire/blackfire:2
        environment:
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID: XXXX
            BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN: XXXX
```

### Using OrbStack Routing

Instead of using regular ports, you can also use the OrbStack URL generation feature. OrbStack generates for each running container a URL like `https://web.orb.local` and allows for easier access to your services without needing to manage port mappings.
This allows running multiple Shopware instances at the same time without port conflicts.

Create a `compose.override.yaml` with:

```yaml
services:
    web:
        ports: !override []
        environment:
            APP_URL: https://web.sw-trunk.orb.local
    database:
        ports: !override []
    adminer:
        ports: !override []
    valkey:
        ports: !override []
    mailer:
        ports: !override []
    opensearch:
        ports: !override []
```

The APP_URL environment variable always starts with `web.<project-name>.orb.local` and the rest of the URL is generated by the project name. The project name is the folder name of the project. So if you have a project called `shopware`, the URL will be `https://web.shopware.orb.local`. If you have a project called `shopware-6`, the URL will be `https://web.shopware-6.orb.local`.

You can also open `https://orb.local` in your browser and see all running containers and their URLs.

To run the Storefront Watcher you will need to set an additional `PROXY_URL` environment variable. This is needed to make the watcher work with the OrbStack routing.

```bash
docker compose run --rm -p 9998:9998 -p 9999:9999 -e PROXY_URL=http://localhost web composer watch:storefront
```
